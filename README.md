# Kaggel-Chalange

# Certainly! Thank you for the challenge(EDA). 

## Let’s break it down step by step:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

##### First, we need to explore the dataset and understand its features.

* Since you mentioned insolvency prediction, I found some related data to bankruptcy status.

### we have the dataset

#### we’ll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features, distributions, and potential correlations.

#### Train-Test-Validation Split:
######  As per your instructions, we’ll split the data into three sets:
* Train Set (70%): Used for training the models.
* Validation Set (20%): Used for hyperparameter tuning.
* Test Set (10%): Kept unknown until the final evaluation.
* We’ll set the random state to 55 for reproducibility.
* Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
* Start with simple models before considering complex ones.
* Some suitable classifiers for binary classification (bankrupt vs. non-bankrupt) include:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

#### For each model, we’ll:
* Train it on the train set.
* Tune hyperparameters using the validation set.
* Evaluate its performance using F1-score.

###### the goal is to achieve an F1-score greater than 0.67 on the test set.

* Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction (Optional):
* Analyze feature importance and select relevant features.
* Consider techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
